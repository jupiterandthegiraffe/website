00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,170
We use websites every day.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:14,219
They help us to learn… find
information… communicate… and have fun.

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:20,525
But do you know that behind each
website lies a fantastic world of HTML?

4
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,680
HTML is a language for creating websites.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,879
With HTML we can bring our ideas to life.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,209
The HTML language has
words, called HTML elements.

7
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:42,050
BODY… H1… P… IMG… and so on.

8
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:50,289
The HTML elements are like Lego
blocks that are combined together to
create websites, apps and web toys.

9
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:53,599
HTML has a best friend, called CSS.

10
00:00:54,749 --> 00:01:03,870
CSS is the language for setting
colors, sizes and other visual
qualities of HTML elements.

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:11,579
And the best news is - with the
help of HTML Planet it is easy and
fun to learn both HTML and CSS.

12
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:20,989
HTML Planet is inhabited by friendly
aliens that love to share their skills
with you through exciting adventures.

13
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:34,990
After you pick up enough web
skills you can go to the Create
projects area and freely create
web projects based on ready-made
templates or starting from scratch.

14
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,450
Are you ready for your first adventure?

00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,470

16
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,839
She runs a company
called Super Space Rides.

17
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:51,080

to take you for a ride to HTML Planet.
